.gitignore doesn't seem to be working

*******************************************
Abc5 (or maybe 'Spell it, hear it, see it')
*******************************************

always have blow.wav in the playback folder, or the program may not even run.

To build:

You need:
DAllegro5
jeca

Use 'cf -r' to build program.

To run double click the 'abc5' [possibly 'abc5.exe'] that has the coloured ABC icon, (not to be confused with the 'abc' that does not have a '5' on the end).

Enter the comma seperated names and words shown on the window.

Example:
Type 'fire' then hit Enter.
To bring the text back up, hit Enter. You don't have to see the text to type more words and names in.
To clear the picture and just show the text, hit Enter again.

Used Enter to clear you've just typed in also.

To add your own sounds and pictures, just paste them into the Playback folder. Also you could record your self each letter and put it in 'Letters' folder, you may want to make a copy of the 'Letters' folder before hand.

Note: if your using Linux, the sounds may not work.

This program was made with (as follows):

The D Programming langage: www.digitalmars.com
Allegro 5: www.liballeg.org // have to change this
DAllegro5: https://github.com/SiegeLord/DAllegro5
